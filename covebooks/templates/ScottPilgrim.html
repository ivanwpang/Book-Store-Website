				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					Scott Pilgrim plays in a band which aspires to success. He dates Knives Chau, a high-school girl five years younger, 
					and he hasn't recovered from being dumped by his former girlfriend, now a success with her own band. 
					When Scott falls for Ramona Flowers, he has trouble breaking up with Knives and tries to romance Ramona. 
					As if juggling two women wasn't enough, Ramona comes with baggage: seven ex-lovers, 
					with each of whom Scott must do battle to the death in order to win Ramona.
